  aboutMe:
    "Hello, I am Aman Trivedi from Indore. I graduated in B.Tech Mechanical Engineering in 2022 from Prestige College, RGPV University. During my engineering, I was part of a team that was building a platform for placement services. This exposure excited me and I was keen to build a career in coding. But I didn't have relevant skills. So, I joined Masai school, which offers a 30-week of full-time course on a full-stack web development program. At Masai school, we get hands-on experience to learn front-end and back-end technologies. And also works 600 hours of coding and 60 hours of building logical abilities and builds a minimum of 5-6 collaborative projects. About my family, my father is a serviceman in a chocolate factory and mother is a teacher and my younger brother is a student. My hobbies and leisure interests include playing chess. I have been a winner in my college. And have a keen interest in watching documentary movies.",
